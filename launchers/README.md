# Game Launchers

This directory contains standalone launchers for JGame games.

## Quick Start

### Windows

```batch
chess.bat
checkers.bat
solitaire.bat
goose.bat
```

### Linux/macOS

```bash
chmod +x *.sh  # First time only
./chess.sh
./checkers.sh
./solitaire.sh
./goose.sh
```

## Notes

- Requires Java 25+ and Maven
- Launches games in standalone mode (Human vs Human by default)
- For AI opponents, use the full JGame client: `run-client.bat` or `run-client.sh`
